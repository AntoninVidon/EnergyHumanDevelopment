# Conclusion

In conclusion, the study of human development and energy consumption is insightful and very relevant. Understanding how education, life expectancy, wealth, overall energy consumption, and the shift to renewable energies relate to each other today, is relevant to make decisions on how we shape future societies. Future societies that will consume more energy and rely on more renewable energy without sacrificing quality of life.

## Answers
**How is the increase in energy consumption boosting the education system in order to cope with theindustrial ”boom” generated by rapid economic growth?**
..human development indicator (HDI)

**What are the most important factor that determine how a variation of energy consumption affect the human development index of a country?**

**Is the rate at which the HDI increases with respect to energy consumption constant, or does it start to decrease after a specific GDP per capita?**

**Is an energy mix oriented towards renewable sources associated with good human development indicators?**
Yes, countries that have a high share and consumption of renewable energy are perform better in the categories of the HDI. Countries are richer and people get education and live longer. while a strong causation in this relationship is unlikely as GDP is a strong confounding variable, we do see that those countries with high renewable energy exceed those countries that match their wealth but not their renewable energy sourcing.

**What characterises the countries that have the most renewable energy mix?**
Countries with a highly renewable energy mix, get a high share of their energy from hydro but also still require large amounts of oil. Other countries should investigate the possibility of hydro energy more closely where possible. Additionally, the case of Iceland also suggests that even very high energy consumption, that is likely in more countries in the future, can be serviced by a highly renewable energy grid.
Both high income and upper middle income countries currently grow their share of renewable energy quickly, indicating that not only *the* richest countries can make their energy mix more sustainable. However, this does not neglect the fact that wealthier countries have more capacity to invest in renewables and that developing countries might need support in this area.

## Summary
In our report, we found out how that while economic growth and better living standards are associated with higher energy consumption, this resource-driven growth stagnates at a certain level and that other measures need to be found for further growth. This fact encourages the idea that we should not only increase consumption and economic production further but also consider other measures to effectively improve education and life expectancy. Instead, nations can invest in greener technologies like Iceland, New Zealand, or Norway to grow beyond the limitations that the simple GDP-energy relation faces at some point.
