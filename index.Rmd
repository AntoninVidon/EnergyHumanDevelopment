# Introduction

The effect of energy consumption on economic growth is a wide area of research and teaches us that energy is in fact one of the most important driver of economic development. Considering the growing importance of different energy sources and the looming transition from fossil fuels to renewable growth, it is important to understand how energy consumption and human livelihood are related. In our study, we therefore weigh human development and its core components, as collected in the human development indicator (HDI): A long and healthy life, level of education and standard of living (GDP per capita and related). We put to the test some intuitive insights between energy consumption and human development.

**With this analysis we answer the following five questions**:

1. How is the increase in energy consumption boosting the education system in order to cope with theindustrial ”boom” generated by rapid economic growth?
2. What are the most important factor that determine how a variation of energy consumption affect the human development index of a country?  
3. Is the rate at which the HDI increases with respect to energy consumption constant, or does it start to decrease after a specific GDP per capita?
4. Is an energy mix oriented towards renewable sources associated with good human development indicators?
5. What characterises the countries that have the most renewable energy mix?
