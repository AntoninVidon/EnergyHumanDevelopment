Considering the growing importance of renewable energy and the negative effects fossil energy sources can have on human livelihood, we must understand the relation of renewable energy and human development. There is both a positive correlation between HDI and renewable energy consumption both in per capita and in relative terms. However, we can also see that countries with a low share of renewable energy consumption like Hong Kong or Australia achieve high levels of human development. Moreover, does the plot on the left support the fact that higher overall energy consumption correlates with human development. Nevertheless, we can deduct that more developed countries also invest more in renewable energy. Statistically significantly more countries with a high share of renewable energy are also those countries in which citizens have a higher life expectancy and tend to receive more education. While life expectancy is left-skewed and years of schooling is normally distributed, the share of renewables is strongly right-skewed. This indicates great room for improvement in investments into renewable energy. 5.2 Characteristics of Countries With a High Share of Renewable Energy (There is no data on renewable energy available for 91 countries. These countries are mainly in Africa.) The countries with the highest share of renewable energy are Iceland, Norway, and Brazil. These and many other countries that have a high share of renewable energy have a long shoreline compared to the countries sizes. (Low income data is missing) How many countries per income? What income ranges are associated with the income levels? TODO: Title Observations: The countries highest share of renewable energy in their energy Stronger correlation between absolute renewable energy consumption because there is also a strong positive correlation between human development and energy consumption independent of the energy source Norway and Iceland are far outliers in the renewable energy consumption with 65 to nearly 80% renewables in their energy mix Citizens of many countries consume a similar amount of renewable energy but experience varying levels of human development 5.2.1 Ideas: outlier analysis filter on GDP or population to make trends appear cluster countries by energy mix development of different income areas On the other hand, how does the production of coal and gas energy leading to more pollution might foster and hinder human development at the same time? - countries might consume other energy than they produce - "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
