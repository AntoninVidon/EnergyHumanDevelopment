Considering the growing importance of renewable energy and the negative effects fossil energy sources can have on human livelihood, we must understand the relation of renewable energy and human development. There is both a positive correlation between HDI and renewable energy consumption both in per capita and in relative terms. However, we can also see that countries with a low share of renewable energy consumption like Hong Kong or Australia achieve high levels of human development. Moreover, does the plot on the left support the fact that higher overall energy consumption correlates with human development. Nevertheless, we can deduct that more developed countries also invest more in renewable energy. Statistically significantly more countries with a high share of renewable energy are also those countries in which citizens have a higher life expectancy and tend to receive more education. While life expectancy is left-skewed and years of schooling is normally distributed, the share of renewables is strongly right-skewed. This indicates great room for improvement in investments into renewable energy. 5.2 Characteristics of Countries With a High Share of Renewable Energy (There is no data on renewable energy available for 91 countries. These countries are mainly in Africa.) Now, we want to analyse countries have a high share of renewable energy and what differentiates them from the rest of the world. Countries and the Share of Renewable Energy in Their Energy Mixes The countries with the highest share of renewable energy are Iceland, Norway, and Brazil. These and many other countries that have a high share of renewable energy have a long shoreline compared to the countries sizes. The most renewabl countries rely on hydro energy but also oil for a large share of their per capita energy consumption. While it is commonly assumed that renewable energies cannot reliably service a large energy demand, the example of Iceland indicates that this is must not be true (of course considering political and geographical circumstances). Brazil and Ecuador are two poorer countries than the rest but manage to achieve a high share of renewable energy, further indicating that sustainable energy consumption is not only achievable for rich nations. The major difference between the top ten countries and the rest of the world is the share of hydro energy. It is 23% higher than the one of the rest of the world. Additionally, the top ten countries use 24.6% less coal in their energy mix. Interestingly, wind, biofuel, and solar make up a very small share of the energy mix in all countries despite them being the ones that many countries put the most political attention to. Contrary, to common expectation, not the richest countries but upper middle income countries grow their renewable energy quickest. Instead, populous upper middle income countries like Brazil, Turkey, and China, drive steeper growth. Nevertheless, many upper-middle income countries do not currently increase their share of renewable energy. Albeit the average growth is slightly slower for high income countries, growth is more consistent across high income countries. An upward trend for all high-income trend could be identified. Lower middle income countries have only seen a slight uptick in recent years. On the one hand, countries like India and Venezuela slowly drive up the share of renewables. On the other hand, countries like Pakistan, Vietnam, or Sri Lanka have recently seen their renewable energy share drop drastically.
