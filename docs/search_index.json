We choose to restrict our multivariate analysis to the narrowest time range. This is exactly the intersection of all ranges : 1990-2019. We note that this plot does not tell us anything about missing values. Indeed, a given observation might be missing although within the time range of the data set. 3.2 Selecting the variables We hope to be able to analyze and understand the cross-correlation between energy consumption and human development. To do so we figured we would need the following: data indicators for HDI and all its major components, namely: GDP, life_expectancy, years_of_schooling; figures for consumption per energy type; population. variable dataset ISO_code worldbank_country_info HDI HDI population population years_of_schooling un_years_of_schooling life_expectancy life_expectancy GDP worldbank_gdp fossil_fuel owid_energy_data hydro owid_energy_data low_carb owid_energy_data nuclear owid_energy_data other_renew owid_energy_data renew owid_energy_data solar owid_energy_data wind owid_energy_data coal owid_energy_data gas owid_energy_data oil owid_energy_data biofuel owid_energy_data primary owid_energy_data ## [1] 5070 ## [1] 5070 ## [1] 5070 ## [1] 5070 ## [1] 5070 ## [1] 5070 #TODOS: - What countries are missing from the data set that exist in real life - How many regions maximum compared to final dataset - Make data cleaning steps more explicit - removing variables - limiting time frame - merge and exclude duplicates "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
