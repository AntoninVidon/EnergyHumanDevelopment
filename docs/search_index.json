However, it is not only the economic development that relates to energy consumption but also broader human development. Considering the growing importance of different energy sources and the looming transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, it is important to understand how energy consumption and human livelihood are related. In our study, we therefore examine human development and its core components, as collected in the human development indicator (HDI): A long and healthy life, the duration of education and the standard of living. This allows us to highlight potential misconceptions about the relationships between the development stages of countries and suggestions for policy-making. With this analysis we answer the following five questions: How is the increase in energy consumption boosting the education system in order to cope with the industrial boom generated by rapid economic growth? Is the rate at which the HDI increases with respect to energy consumption constant, or does it start to decrease after a specific level of consumption? Is a highly renewable energy mix associated with strong human development indicators? What characterizes the countries that have the most renewable energy mix?

We choose to restrict our multivariate analysis to the narrowest time range. This is exactly the intersection of all ranges : 1990-2019. We note that this plot does not tell us anything about missing values. Indeed, a given observation might be missing although within the time range of the data set. 3.2 Selecting the variables We hope to be able to analyze and understand the cross-correlation between energy consumption and human development. To do so, we need the following: Data indicators for HDI and all its major components, namely: GDP, life_expectancy, years_of_schooling; Figures for consumption per energy type; Population data and other country indicators like geographic region. 3.3 Data transformation procedure Our data transformation works as follows. Determine the needed variables from the respective datasets Create dataframes for each of the datasets that only contains the needed variables and time frames to avoid having an unnecessarily large final dataframe that would slow down analyses Energy data GDP data Life expectancy data Schooling data Population data HDI data Filter the dataframes on common ISO codes (unique identifiers for countries) such that only countries for which all dataframes match up are selected. We find that there is little to no variance in the countries from the different datasets but that some include geographic regions that are filtered by this procedure as they do not have ISO codes. Convert previously wide dataframes into a long format such that each row is one unique observation of country and year Merge all dataframes on their ISO code and year Add the country names from the library countrycode based on the ISO codes to guarantee a common naming scheme and simplify interpretation. We use the resulting master_df as our database in all further analyses.

We then dive into each of the primary sets to understand why data is missing, namely: energy consumption, GDP, life expectancy, years of schooling, and life expectancy. 4.1 Missing values for the merged dataframe Data sparsity is quite inconsistent across variables. We observe that missing data mainly concerns energy related variables. Hence, for a significant proportion of countries, it will be challenging to analyze the energy mix. Map of data availability across countries for all variables At the intuition suggests, the missing data is mainly located in central Africa. By contrast, Europe and North America countries all fall into the 90 to 100% range of data availability. 4.2 Dive into each primar dataset : understanding the missing values Energy consumption Data description: Energy consumption of different countries by the type of energy production. Link to data. We focus on the 1990-2020 time-frame. Observations: 40% of rows are missing 75% of the variables. This might become a problem when comparing countries over time as this might suggest that some countries have only little data for a limited number of years. 30% of rows are complete, such that the energy mix can be fully analyzed. The remaining 30% of rows also miss a 56% to 81% of variables with some exceptions. In order to have enough data to draw solid conclusions on these time series, we will probably have to select a sub-sample of countries. Lets now group the countries together so as to visualize missing data by geographic region. Observations: Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America have the most missing data. Europe &amp; central Asia, as well as North America have the least missing values. For all regions, data availability remains largely constant over time with a high spike in 2020, year for which the data might not be collected yet. For some countries, no region could be identified. This is indicated by the label Unmatched countries. For better comparisons, these countries will be matched. GDP Data description: Measure of a countrys economic output computed by adding up the monetary value (in current $) of all finished goods and services made within a country for each year. Link to data. We focus on the 1990-2019 time-frame. Observations: The highest sparsity is recorded for the most ancient years of the time frame. Data becomes increasingly unavailable as we go back in time. Complete cases account for almost 80% of the data. For all of these countries, the data gives a full picture of the evolution of GDP per capita across time. A small proportion of countries present a missing pattern of total unavailability of GDP per capita. The list of those countries is displayed just below.

Energy consumption fuels economic prosperity Analyzing the impact of energy consumption on GDP and mean years of schooling is not that easy as the three variables suffer from cross directional causality. The intuition suggests a high correlation between energy consumption and GDP. Indeed, most economies are highly energy dependent and many production and consumption activities involve energy as a central input. This graph emphasizes the intuitive idea that energy is required to stimulate growth. More consumption generally results in an increase in the economic output. Parallel increase of EC and YOS in economic growth As a country benefits from economic prosperity with a higher GDP per capita, this one might allocate more resources to education to foster the formation of human capital. This would enhance the schooling system and lead to the increase of the mean year of schooling for a given cohort. The path towards economic maturity consists of a simultaneous rise of energy consumption and mean years of schooling. To become more productive, a country invests in education in order for its proportion of educated workers to increase. On the plot just above, we notice that the expect years of schooling seems to converge towards a value between 15 and 17 years, value that we observe for mature countries. 5.2 Co-movement of energy consumption and HDI An overview of HDI in the world From the available data, we observe high variability of the human development index. It ranges from the highest values in Europe, North America, Oceania and Japan to the lowest in central Africa. Segmented analysis of HDI The increase of energy consumption of a population generally tends to affect its way of living. The intuition suggests that, in the long-term, consuming more energy is correlated with an improvement of the the human development of a population and hence, an increase of the HDI. There seems to be a threshold of energy consumption per capita which separates two types of HDI behaviors. For countries with low level of energy consumption, the causal relationship between energy consumption and HDI is very strong, as suggested by the high value of \\(R^2\\). By contrast, there does not seem to be a correlation for countries with high level of energy consumption. Intuitively, the investments made by a country on the verge of becoming wealthier will generally have a much larger effect on human development (health system, education). 5.3 Association of human development and renewable energy (Disclaimer: There is no data on renewable energy available for 91/169 countries. These countries are mainly in Africa and/or low-income countries and thus limit the analysis for these areas.) The earlier analysis of GDP and energy consumption shows that economic growth, energy consumption, and human development are correlated until a threshold on the economic growth is reached. Considering the growing importance of renewable energy and the negative effects fossil energy sources can have on human livelihood, we must understand the relation of renewable energy and human development. There is a positive correlation between HDI and renewable energy consumption both in per capita and in relative terms. However, we can also see that countries with a low share of renewable energy consumption like Hong Kong or Australia achieve high levels of human development. Generally, we can see that on a percentage-basis the most renewable countries are either in Europe or Latin America. Additionally, the left plot supports the idea that higher overall energy consumption correlates with human development. Nevertheless, we can deduct that more developed countries also invest more in renewable energy. The following graph show the relationships, correlations and distribution between the HDI score, life expectancy, years of schooling, and the share of renewable energy compared to overall energy consumption. Countries with a high share of renewable energy are also those countries in which citizens have a higher life expectancy and receive more education. While life expectancy is left-skewed and years of schooling looks normally distributed, the share of renewables is strongly right-skewed. This indicates great room for improvement in investments into renewable energy. 5.4 Characteristics of countries with a high share of renewable energy Now, we want to analyse countries that have a high share of renewable energy and what differentiates them from the rest of the world. Countries and the share of renewable energy in their energy mixes The countries with the highest share of renewable energy are Iceland, Norway, and Brazil. These and many other countries that have a high share of renewable energy have a long shoreline compared to the countries sizes. The most renewable countries rely on hydropower but also oil for a large share of their per capita energy consumption. While it is commonly assumed that renewable energies cannot reliably service a large energy demand, the example of Iceland indicates that this does not have to be true (of course considering political and geographical circumstances). Brazil and Ecuador are two poorer countries than the rest but manage to achieve a high share of renewable energy, further indicating that sustainable energy consumption is not only achievable for rich nations. The major difference between the top ten countries and the rest of the world is the share of hydropower. It is 23% higher than the one of the rest of the world. Additionally, the top ten countries use 24.6% less coal in their energy mix. Interestingly, wind, biofuel, and solar make up a very small share of the energy mix in all countries despite them being the ones that many countries put the most political attention to. Contrary, to common expectation, not the richest countries but upper middle income countries grow their renewable energy quickest. Instead, populous upper middle income countries like Brazil, Turkey, and China, record steeper growth. Nevertheless, many upper-middle income countries do not currently increase their share of renewable energy. Albeit the average growth is slightly slower for high income countries, growth is more consistent across high income countries. An upward trend for all high-income trend could be identified. Lower middle income countries have only seen a slight uptick in recent years. On the one hand, countries like India and Venezuela slowly drive up the share of renewables. On the other hand, countries like Pakistan, Vietnam, or Sri Lanka have recently seen their renewable energy share drop drastically.

We observe that the rate at which energy consumption is evolving is significantly higher for countries with medium and high HDI. Across all HDI categories, consumption of coal, oil and gas remains largely dominant. In the case of medium HDI countries, the staggering increase in energy consumption is almost solely supported by fossil energy sources. On the other hand, the evolution of the consumption of non-renewable energy seem to slow down in high HDI countries. The solar energy seem to only be mastered by the wealthiest countries; probably because this specific mean of production might require a lot of prior investments. Interestingly, the potential of this energy source might in fact be higher in countries in central Africa, which benefit from a high level of solar exposition. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 Answers 7.2 Limitations 7.3 Future directions 7.4 Summary", " Chapter 7 Conclusion In conclusion, the study of human development and energy consumption is insightful and very relevant. Understanding how education, life expectancy, wealth, overall energy consumption, and the shift to renewable energies relate to each other today, is crucial to make decisions on how we shape future societies. These will consume more energy and should rely on more renewable energy without sacrificing quality of life. 7.1 Answers How is the increase in energy consumption boosting the education system in order to cope with the industrial boom generated by rapid economic growth ? State of the art has revealed that economic growth is fueled by energy consumption. Moreover, as a country moves forward on its path towards economic prosperity, analyses reveal that it tends to allocate more resources to enhancing its schooling system. This leads to its population being more qualified for complex activities that generate a much higher economic output. On the other hand, we saw that emerging countries are trying to catch-up in terms of education system as their mean year of schooling for a given birth cohort is converging towards a range of mature values, that we observe for economically stable countries. Is the rate at which the HDI increases with respect to energy consumption constant, or does it start to decrease after a specific GDP per capita ? We observe a threshold of energy consumption that separates two types of HDI behavior. Up to a certain level of consumption, the HDI continues to improve. However, if the population continues to consumes more and more energy, it will not succeed in converting it into a better human development. There is no clear relationship between both indicators after this threshold. Intuitively, the investments made by a country on the verge of becoming wealthier have a much larger effect on human development as they are more likely to impact the core components of human development such as health or education. Is an energy mix oriented towards renewable sources associated with good human development indicators ? Yes, countries that have a high share and consumption of renewable energy perform better in the categories of the HDI. Countries are richer and people get better education and live longer. while a strong causation in this relationship is unlikely as GDP is a strong confounding variable, we do see that those countries with high renewable energy exceed those countries that match their wealth but not their renewable energy sourcing. What characterizes the countries that have the most renewable energy mix ? Countries with a highly renewable energy mix get a high share of their energy from hydropower but also still require large amount of oil. Other countries should investigate the possibility of hydropower energy more closely when possible. Additionally, the case of Iceland suggests that even a very high energy consumption - which will concern a significant proportion of countries in the future - can be serviced by a highly renewable energy grid. Both high income and upper middle income countries currently grow their share of renewable energy quickly, indicating that not only the richest countries can make their energy mix more sustainable. However, this does not neglect the fact that wealthier countries have more capacity to invest in renewables and that developing countries might need support in this area. 7.2 Limitations First, as with many analyses, one of our main constraints is the availability of data. There is no energy mix data for low income countries available and thus any analysis is limited to lower middle income and richer countries. This does not negate our findings but does not allow making conclusions on low income countries. Second, to craft comprehensible analyses and visualizations, we needed to reduce the data we used either along the temporal or the geographic dimension. However, the raw data is complex and large as it includes both all countries and a time frame reaching back until 1900. This means that one might be able to find more complex relationships like long-term trends when examining both dimensions together. 7.3 Future directions We are particularly interested in three future directions of this line of research. First, should institutions be able to gather more data on low income countries, how are their energy consumption and human development metrics developing and interacting? This is particularly interesting as we might be able to see patterns from developed countries again or discover new patterns. Second, which concrete policy recommendations can be given, when analyzing the drivers and influencing variables in countries that have achieved a highly renewable energy mix and high human development. Third, we are convinced that there lies great potential in predictive and inference-oriented approaches. With this, future researches could explore what the causality between the observed variable is and how trying to influence one might affect the other. 7.4 Summary In our report, we found out that while economic growth and better living standards are associated with higher energy consumption, this resource-driven growth stagnates at a certain level and that other measures need to be found for further growth. This fact encourages the idea that we should not only increase consumption and economic production further but also consider other measures to effectively improve education and life expectancy. Instead, nations can invest in greener technologies like Iceland, New Zealand, or Norway to grow beyond the limitations that the simple GDP-energy relation faces at some point.
