In our study, instead of considering the raw economic growth, we weigh human development and its core components: long and healthy life, level of education and standard of living (GDP per capita and related). We put to the test some intuitive insights between energy consumption and human development. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources This is an overview of all data sources for this project. The multivariate analysis conducted in the rest of the book is solely based on these data sets. Population Data description: Total population is based on the de facto definition of population, which counts all residents regardless of legal status or citizenship. Link to data. GDP Data description: Measure of a countrys economic output computed by adding up the monetary value (in current $) of all finished goods and services made within a country for a given year. Link to data. HDI Data description: Composite index measuring average achievement in three basic dimensions of human development-a long and healthy life, knowledge and a decent standard of living. Link to data. Life expectancy Data description: Mean length of life of an actual birth cohort (all individuals born in a given year). Link to data. Years of schooling Data description: Number of years of schooling that a child of school entrance age can expect to receive if prevailing patterns of age-specific enrollment rates persist throughout the childs life. Link to data. Energy consumption Data description: Energy consumption by source, country and year. Link to data. Country info Data description: ISO code, region and level of income for all worldbank countries. The .csv dataframe is in the same zip as the one containing GDP data (first source). Link to data. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Selecting the time range", " Chapter 3 Data transformation We aim at merging all data into one tidy master data frame within which each observation will correspond to one country and one year. 3.1 Selecting the time range We hope to keep a sufficiently wide range so as to observe clear change in energy consumption behavior across time. We choose to restrict our multivariate analysis to the narrowest time range. This is exactly the intersection of all ranges : 1990-2019. We note that this plot does not tell us anything about missing values. Indeed, a given observation might be missing although within the time range of the data set. ## [1] 5070 ## [1] 5070 ## [1] 5070 ## [1] 5070 ## [1] 5070 ## [1] 5070 #TODOS: - What countries are missing from the data set that exist in real life - How many regions maximum compared to final dataset - Make data cleaning steps more explicit - removing variables - limiting time frame - merge and exclude duplicates "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Missing values for the merged dataframe 4.2 Energy consumption 4.3 GDP 4.4 Life expectancy 4.5 Years of schooling", " Chapter 4 Missing values In this chapter, we analyze the missing data in our four primary data sets on energy consumption, GDP, life expectancy, years of schooling, and life expectancy. 4.1 Missing values for the merged dataframe 4.2 Energy consumption Data description: Energy consumption of different countries by the type of energy production. Link to data. We focus on the 1990-2020 time-frame. Observations: 40% of rows are missing 75% of the variables. This might become a problem when comparing countries over time as this might suggest that some countries have only little data for a limited number of years. 30% of rows are complete, such that the energy mix can be fully analyzed. The remaining 30% of rows also miss a 56% to 81% of variables with some exceptions. In order to have enough data to draw solid conclusions on these time series, we will probably have to select a sub-sample of countries. Lets now group the countries together so as to visualize missing data by geographic region. Observations: Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America have the most missing data. Europe &amp; central Asia, as well as North America have the least missing values. For all regions, data availability remains largely constant over time with a high spike in 2020, year for which the data might not be collected yet. For some countries, no region could be identified. This is indicated by the label Unmatched countries. For better comparisons, these countries will be matched. 4.3 GDP Data description: Measure of a countrys economic output computed by adding up the monetary value (in current $) of all finished goods and services made within a country for each year. Link to data. We focus on the 1990-2019 time-frame. Observations: The highest sparsity is recorded for the most ancient years of the time frame. Data becomes increasingly unavailable as we go back in time. Complete cases account for almost 80% of the data. For all of these countries, the data gives a full picture of the evolution of GDP per capita across time. A small proportion of countries present a missing pattern of total unavailability of GDP per capita. The list of those countries is displayed just below. We see that these correspond to countries that either (1) do not share their data eg. Korea or (2) have a very small population and/or economic output eg. small islands like St.Martin. Countries with full missing pattern Gibraltar Not classified St. Martin (French part) Korea, Dem. Peoples Rep.  British Virgin Islands 4.4 Life expectancy Data description: Mean length of life of an actual birth cohort (all individuals born in a given year). Link to data. We focus on the 1990-2019 time-frame. Observations: Life expectancy data becomes slightly sparser as we go back in time. However, the proportion of missing data stays within the range 6-8%. Complete cases account for almost 90% of the data. For all of these countries, the data gives a full picture of the evolution of life expectancy across time. The second most frequent missing pattern corresponds to total unavailability of life expectancy within the time frame. The list of those countries is displayed just below. We see that these correspond to either (1) unclassified data or (2) countries with very small population for which it is difficult to conduct data collection eg. small islands like American Samoa. Countries with full missing pattern Andorra American Samoa Gibraltar Not classified Monaco Northern Mariana Islands Nauru Turks and Caicos Islands Tuvalu British Virgin Islands 4.5 Years of schooling Data description: Number of years of schooling that a child of school entrance age can expect to receive if prevailing patterns of age-specific enrollment rates persist throughout the childs life. Link to data. We focus on the 1990-2019 time-frame. Observations: As for previous variables, sparsity increases when we look at more ancient years, but never exceeds 12%. Complete cases account for almost 90% of the data. For all of these countries, the data gives a full picture of the evolution of the years of schooling across time. A few countries are not ranked in terms of HDI. These countries are displayed below and correspond to countries that either (1) do not share their data eg. Korea or (2) countries with very small population (empirically &lt; 40k) for which it is difficult to conduct data collection eg. Nauru.
