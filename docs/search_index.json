In our study, instead of considering the raw economic growth, we weigh human development and its core components: long and healthy life, level of education and standard of living (GDP per capita and related). We put to the test some intuitive insights between energy consumption and human development.

We choose to restrict our multivariate analysis to the narrowest time range. This is exactly the intersection of all ranges : 1990-2019. We note that this plot does not tell us anything about missing values. Indeed, a given observation might be missing although within the time range of the data set. 3.2 Selecting the variables ## [1] 5070 ## [1] 5070 ## [1] 5070 ## [1] 5070 ## [1] 5070 ## [1] 5070 #TODOS: - What countries are missing from the data set that exist in real life - How many regions maximum compared to final dataset - Make data cleaning steps more explicit - removing variables - limiting time frame - merge and exclude duplicates "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Missing values for the merged dataframe 4.2 Energy consumption 4.3 GDP 4.4 Life expectancy 4.5 Years of schooling", " Chapter 4 Missing values In this chapter, we analyze the missing data in our four primary data sets on energy consumption, GDP, life expectancy, years of schooling, and life expectancy. 4.1 Missing values for the merged dataframe 4.2 Energy consumption Data description: Energy consumption of different countries by the type of energy production. Link to data. We focus on the 1990-2020 time-frame. Observations: 40% of rows are missing 75% of the variables. This might become a problem when comparing countries over time as this might suggest that some countries have only little data for a limited number of years. 30% of rows are complete, such that the energy mix can be fully analyzed. The remaining 30% of rows also miss a 56% to 81% of variables with some exceptions. In order to have enough data to draw solid conclusions on these time series, we will probably have to select a sub-sample of countries. Lets now group the countries together so as to visualize missing data by geographic region. Observations: Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America have the most missing data. Europe &amp; central Asia, as well as North America have the least missing values. For all regions, data availability remains largely constant over time with a high spike in 2020, year for which the data might not be collected yet. For some countries, no region could be identified. This is indicated by the label Unmatched countries. For better comparisons, these countries will be matched. 4.3 GDP Data description: Measure of a countrys economic output computed by adding up the monetary value (in current $) of all finished goods and services made within a country for each year. Link to data. We focus on the 1990-2019 time-frame. Observations: The highest sparsity is recorded for the most ancient years of the time frame. Data becomes increasingly unavailable as we go back in time. Complete cases account for almost 80% of the data. For all of these countries, the data gives a full picture of the evolution of GDP per capita across time. A small proportion of countries present a missing pattern of total unavailability of GDP per capita. The list of those countries is displayed just below. We see that these correspond to countries that either (1) do not share their data eg. Korea or (2) have a very small population and/or economic output eg. small islands like St.Martin. Countries with full missing pattern Gibraltar Not classified St. Martin (French part) Korea, Dem.

We focus on the 1990-2019 time-frame. Observations: Life expectancy data becomes slightly sparser as we go back in time. However, the proportion of missing data stays within the range 6-8%. Complete cases account for almost 90% of the data. For all of these countries, the data gives a full picture of the evolution of life expectancy across time. The second most frequent missing pattern corresponds to total unavailability of life expectancy within the time frame. The list of those countries is displayed just below. We see that these correspond to either (1) unclassified data or (2) countries with very small population for which it is difficult to conduct data collection eg. small islands like American Samoa. Countries with full missing pattern Andorra American Samoa Gibraltar Not classified Monaco Northern Mariana Islands Nauru Turks and Caicos Islands Tuvalu British Virgin Islands 4.5 Years of schooling Data description: Number of years of schooling that a child of school entrance age can expect to receive if prevailing patterns of age-specific enrollment rates persist throughout the childs life. Link to data. We focus on the 1990-2019 time-frame. Observations: As for previous variables, sparsity increases when we look at more ancient years, but never exceeds 12%. Complete cases account for almost 90% of the data. For all of these countries, the data gives a full picture of the evolution of the years of schooling across time. A few countries are not ranked in terms of HDI. These countries are displayed below and correspond to countries that either (1) do not share their data eg. Korea or (2) countries with very small population (empirically &lt; 40k) for which it is difficult to conduct data collection eg. Nauru.

Considering the growing importance of renewable energy and the negative effects fossil energy sources can have on human livelihood, we must understand the relation of renewable energy and human development. There is both a positive correlation between HDI and renewable energy consumption both in per capita and in relative terms. However, we can also see that countries with a low share of renewable energy consumption like Hong Kong or Australia achieve high levels of human development. Moreover, does the plot on the left support the fact that higher overall energy consumption correlates with human development. Nevertheless, we can deduct that more developed countries also invest more in renewable energy. Statistically significantly more countries with a high share of renewable energy are also those countries in which citizens have a higher life expectancy and tend to receive more education. While life expectancy is left-skewed and years of schooling is normally distributed, the share of renewables is strongly right-skewed. This indicates great room for improvement in investments into renewable energy. 5.2 Characteristics of Countries With a High Share of Renewable Energy (There is no data on renewable energy available for 91 countries. These countries are mainly in Africa.) ## [1] &quot;C:/Users/anton/Documents/Cours/4A/STAT 5702/energyhumandevelopment&quot; ## [1] &quot;#470E61&quot; &quot;#470D60&quot; TODO: Make as map (Low income data is missing) How many countries per income?

TODO: Title Observations: The countries highest share of renewable energy in their energy Stronger correlation between absolute renewable energy consumption because there is also a strong positive correlation between human development and energy consumption independent of the energy source Norway and Iceland are far outliers in the renewable energy consumption with 65 to nearly 80% renewables in their energy mix Citizens of many countries consume a similar amount of renewable energy but experience varying levels of human development 5.2.1 Ideas: outlier analysis filter on GDP or population to make trends appear cluster countries by energy mix development of different income areas On the other hand, how does the production of coal and gas energy leading to more pollution might foster and hinder human development at the same time? - countries might consume other energy than they produce - "],["results-antonins-part.html", "Chapter 6 Results Antonins part 6.1 Cross directional causality btw. EC, GDP and YOS 6.2 Co-movement of energy consumption and HDI", " Chapter 6 Results Antonins part 6.1 Cross directional causality btw. EC, GDP and YOS The acronyms EC, GDP and YOS will be used to refer to energy consumption, gross domestic product and years of schooling respectively. Energy consumption fuels economic prosperity Analyzing the impact of energy consumption on GDP and mean years of schooling is not that easy as the three variables suffer from cross directional causality. The intuition suggests a high correlation between energy consumption and GDP. Indeed, most economies are highly energy dependent and many production and consumption activities involve energy as a central input. This graph emphasizes the intuitive idea that energy is required to stimulate growth. More consumption generally results in an increase in the economic output. Parallel increase of EC and YOS in economic growth As a country benefits from economic prosperity with a higher GDP per capita, this one might allocate more resources to education to foster the formation of human capital. This would enhance the schooling system and lead to the increase of the mean year of schooling for a given cohort. The path towards economic maturity consists of a simultaneous rise of energy consumption and mean years of schooling. To become more productive, a country invests in education in order for its proportion of educated workers to increase. On the plot just above, we notice that the expect years of schooling seems to converge towards a value between 15 and 17 years, value that we observe for mature countries. 6.2 Co-movement of energy consumption and HDI 6.2.1 An overview of HDI in the world ## [1] &quot;#470E61&quot; &quot;#470D60&quot; ## 169 codes from your data successfully matched countries in the map ## 0 codes from your data failed to match with a country code in the map ## 74 codes from the map weren&#39;t represented in your data Segmented analysis of HDI The increase of energy consumption of a population generally tends to affect its way of living. The intuition suggests that, in the long-term, consuming more energy is correlated with an improvement of the the human development of a population and hence, an increase of the HDI. There seems to be a threshold of energy consumption per capita which separates two types of HDI behaviors. For countries with low level of energy consumption, the causal relationship between energy consumption and HDI is very strong, as suggested by the high value of \\(R^2\\). For countries with high level of energy consumption, there does not seem to be a correlation between both variables. This might be due to the fact that, when becoming wealthier, a country directs most of its financing power to increase proxies of human development "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 7 Interactive component", " Chapter 7 Interactive component "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 8 Conclusion", " Chapter 8 Conclusion "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
